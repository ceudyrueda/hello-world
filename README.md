Hi Folks!
I am going to do it!! I'm going to be working in my profession, no matter how many months I need to improve my English and my IT skills or If I have to learn a lot of new thinks to be a better IT professional, I'll do it. 
If I  have to work hard, I'll do it,  no matter how much I have to do, to study or sacrifice, I'm going to be working in my carrear and be a great professional.
Beside I have to take care about myself, be kind with me, be gentel, be nice. My life is important, my helth is important and I need to eat well, healty and do excercise.
